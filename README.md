# Weird Web October - Submission Hub

This project serves as a central site to showcase all submissions made for the Weird Web October challenge. Each submission is represented as a link in a responsive grid, with dynamic status indicators showing whether a submission is live or coming soon.

## Features

-   Responsive grid layout that adjusts columns based on screen size, stacking on smaller devices.
-   Each submission link shows its current status:
    -   **Launched**: Clickable links leading to the live submission page.
    -   **Coming Soon**: Non-clickable links with a semi-transparent background, dashed border, and a "Coming Soon" tag.
-   Automatically updates as new submissions are added.
-   Simple data-driven approach for easy management of submission status and URLs.

## How to Use

1. Add each new submission page URL and status (`launched` or `coming soon`) to the `wwo` data array.
2. The grid will automatically update to reflect all current submissions.
3. Click on launched submissions to view them; coming soon submissions are visually distinct and not clickable.
